# Zig fro Atari Breakout
An implementation of the classic atari game in Zig and OpenGL

Following the OpenGL from https://learnopengl.com/In-Practice/2D-Game/Breakout, we will implement this classic game using the openGL bindings.

## Why Zig and Atari?

Zig is a relatively new programming language, this is an opportunity to learn this language, learn openGL and contribute to the early [Zig openGL bindings](https://github.com/ziglibs/zgl).
The tutorial is written in C++, so it is not straighforward to find the same (or better) implementation in Zig. But at least the architecture is there, and the process is guided, so I think it is an easy way to start with the language
